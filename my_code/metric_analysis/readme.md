Take a look in the analysis_output.md file to see the featutres that were included; different trials used different features

Data from Trial1 should NOT be used. The data for DBSNP r1 and AUC (on teh full dataset) were flipped, which may be causing many of the problems that I had noted before. This does not affect subsetted data, but does affect everything else.

I plan to re-run trial 2, and to deprecate trial 1.
